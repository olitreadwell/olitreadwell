With a deep expertise in React.js and Node.js, I've consistently focused on achieving key business outcomes. Over time, I've developed a knack for devising creative strategies that moves the needle on these metrics. Beyond coding, I've had the privilege of being a mentor and coach to hundreds of junior engineers, many of whom have carved successful paths in the tech world. Some of my proudest achievements include:

- **Doubled Monthly Subscriptions**: Developed a universal paywall structure at Condé Nast, resulting in a 100% YoY increase in monthly subscriptions for Vanity Fair and Wired.

- **Boosted Engagement by 15%**: Transitioned the Rewards platform at WorkTango from Rails to ReactJS.

- **Improved Developer Efficiency**: Introduced a modular design system at WorkTango to enhance UI consistency and increase the speed at which developers could work.

- **Enhanced Software Performance by 20%**: Refactored two old codebases at Union Metrics to utilize Rails 4, optimizing performance.

- **Elevated Brand Reach**: Rolled out new design elements & ReactJS components for 26 media brands at Condé Nast, uplifting readership and SEO.

- **Enhanced Book Sales**: Deployed an effective marketing website for author Jon Cohn's book 'Slashtag', leading to a spike in sales.

- **Supported Museum Transition**: Assisted Mexic-Arte Museum in establishing a web presence before transitioning to a web-only format during renovations.

- **Advanced Product Licensing**: At Bypass Mobile, conceived and executed a JSON-API spec product licensing platform.

- **Slashed Resolution Time by 50%**: Compiled a knowledge base of frequent customer technical issues at Union Metrics.

- **Strengthened Customer Relations**: Bridged the gap between the customer and engineering teams at Union Metrics to promptly address and fix customer concerns.


But my commitments extend beyond coding. I've always been an avid public speaker and educator. My driving force has been a desire to ‘do good’ and to leverage technology optimally. In my coding and mentoring, I've consistently emphasized the importance of using technology responsibly and ethically. By doing so, I aim to leave a lasting, positive impact on both the industry and society at large. As I venture forward, my goal remains clear: to fuse innovation with purpose and to inspire the next generation of tech enthusiasts.
