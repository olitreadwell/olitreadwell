As a senior software engineer, I have dedicated my career to creating dynamic platforms and applications by tying development best practices to broader business goals.

Examples of my career highlights include:
► Rebuilding a customer-facing platform by updating the feature set and UI/UX for Kazoo.

► Increasing monthly subscriptions for Vanity Fair and Wired by over 100% year over year by testing and iterating an agnostic paywall for use across all brand sites for Condé Nast.

► Mentoring and developing future software engineers as a technical trainer full-time for Galvanize, Inc and part-time for General Assembly Austin, CODEACADEMY, and Code Austin.

In my early career, I had the opportunity to diversify my experience by serving in venture capital, sales, and technology operations roles before transitioning into software development.

Outside of my hands-on work, I have organized events including Refresh Austin, Start-up Weekend, and Silicon Beach Melbourne (in Australia) and am a regular industry speaker for events like Austin on Rails and the General Assembly Congress Austin.
